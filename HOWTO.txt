If you get "Comunication error" under Linux:

1/ find XX-permision.rules file - where XX is some number, usually file can be found in /lib/udev/rules.d
2/ find lines: 
# usbfs-like devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \
			MODE="0664"

and change them to

# usbfs-like devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \
			MODE="0666"

Lines above can be a bit security hole. Therefore one can use recipe below.

Use provided 99-uni-t.rules file and copy it to /lib/udev/rules.d.
If your DSO has different VID/PID than 5656/0832, then add it to 
file before copying.

In both cases computer needs restart of udev or restart of whole system. 


In case you using Windows, consider installing Zadig utility http://zadig.akeo.ie/
and use it to install libusb-win. It is way simpler than installing libusb by hand.
